# Today I Learned

Today I Learned is responsive React web application that was used to begin my React learning process. This app allows users to post random facts that they find interesting and want to share along with a trustworthy source. These facts are placed into categories that users can use to filter results from. Users are also allowed vote on fact posts and mark certain posts as `DISPUTED` if they believe the fact is false.

# Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install all the NPM Packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Sign up for Supabase and make a new database called `facts`
4. Enter your API URL and KEY in `config.json`
5. Run Applicaiton
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Open browser at <http://localhost:3000>

# TODO

Features I will like to implement:

- Add a new React Component that renders an error message on the screen instead of logging it to the console.
- Add ability to delete a fact from the database
