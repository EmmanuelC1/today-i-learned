# Today I Learned

Today I Learned is responsive React web application that was used to begin my React learning process. This app allows users to post random facts that they find interesting and want to share along with a trustworthy source. These facts are placed into categories that users can use to filter results from. Users are also allowed vote on fact posts and mark certain posts as `DISPUTED` if they believe the fact is false.

  - [x] When users don't have all the required fields when sharing new fact
  - [x] Source url is not correctly formatted
  - [x] Error loading facts from database
  - [x] Error uploading facts to database
- [ ] Add ability to delete a fact from the database
