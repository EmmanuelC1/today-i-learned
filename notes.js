    What is React?
        –– React
            • JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).
            • React Library has 3 main characteristics:
                - Based on Components
                - It's Declarative
                - Driven by State
            
            • Component-Based:
                A component is a JS function that contains a piece of the UI (both its content and functionality). We build complex UIs by
                combining multiple components
            • Declarative:
                We only describe what the UI should look like, using a syntax called JSX. Developers never manipulate the DOM directly!
            • Driven by State:
                State is the data that the UI is based on. When we change the state in a component, React automatically updates the DOM.
                This always keeps the UI synchronized with the data.

        –– Why Do We Need A Front-End Library? 
            • Keeping a user interface synchronized with data is really hard and a lot of work in big applications using pure JS. 
                Front-end libraries solve this problem and take hard work away from developers.
            • Libraries enforce a "right" way of structuring and writing application code (leading to less bugs).
            • There are other front-end libraries such as, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and many others, but React is the most 
                popular and most used.
